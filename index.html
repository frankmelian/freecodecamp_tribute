       On my tribute page I would like to invite everyone to an amazing read this books is surprisingly good. 3 years ago I was struggling with what I call my adulthood transition where I really had no idea what to do I mean I was at the end  of  high school and everybody seems to have it figured it out all of my friends already knew their next step but me I really did know what I wanted to become, I knew I like computers and art but make a career out of it am I insane why not being a doctor or like my mom told me an accountant  and at the moment that made sense because as I learned after and I quote “There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.” And the fear of failure is a big thing when transitioning and asking important question in our lives who am I what should I do what should I be these is such a broad topic in which the called self-help industry has been built in, but with one book all of my question where answered and I don’t want to promise that every single problem in your life is going to be answered after all this book tells the story of a boy named Santiago which whom I  resonated a lot but you won’t be told what to do instead you’re going to hear great quotes like “The secret of life, though, is to fall seven times and to get up eight times.” What an amazing message and the truth is I can promise  that this book would make you think and I am certain that at some point some of us feel like the boy of  the story or the merchant but I won’t spoil it for you.
I would like to  apologize in advance if my grammar is not good because English is not my first language.
Thank You.

        Paulo Cohelo August 24, 1947 (age 69) Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The genius master mind behind this book is an amazing guy who by all mean is not perfect anyone who intends to dig in his personal life you’ll see that he has done everything but I have decided to focus on the good things, Cohelo who like most of us was told since a title boy who he had to be and not what he wanted a WRITER. He Started to write at the age of 38 and short after he wrote his second novel that as of today has sold 150 millions copies becoming the third most sold book in history and as I invited you to read the book I want to ask you as well to listen to him Oprah has a very good interview with him on Youtube and you’ll get to know a person who despite all odds after thinking that his life was over he  re-invented himself and became one of the most popular and beloved writers of this era.
